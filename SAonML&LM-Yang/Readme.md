## There are totally 4 python code
### DrugCom.ipynb : 
#### Code for Sentiments Analysis on Reviews of Drugs with Machine Learning models
### symptom2dieases.ipynb : 
#### Code for Disease Detection based on Symptoms with Machine Learning models
### LM.py :
#### Code for Sentiments Analysis using Large language models. 
##### ——You can change the 'model_checkpoint' to whatever language models you want to try (local address or huggingface address, e.g: "Qwen/Qwen1.5-0.5B"). The whole precedure including data processing, invoking pre-trained models, fine-tuning with our dataset and also testing on an unseen testset will be conducted in this code, and related numerical results will be shown finally.

### UI.ipynb:
#### Code for UI front-end interface on sympton analysis. Run this code directly and start the UI website. You can input your symptom, then the algorithm will analyze it and tell you the probable disease.
